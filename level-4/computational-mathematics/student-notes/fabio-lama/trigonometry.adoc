== Intro

If stem:[B = 90], then stem:["AC"] is called the *hypothenuse*, the side
*opposite* of stem:[theta] is stem:[BC] and the remainding side, stem:["AB"], is
*adjacent* to stem:[theta]. Angle stem:[A] is written as stem:[/_"BAC"],
stem:[/_A] or just stem:[A].

Each side of a triangle is named based on the lowercase letter of the angle
opposite of the side.

[stem]
++++
a = "BC"\
b = "AC"\
c = "AB"
++++

The total degree of all angles is always stem:[180°]

[stem]
++++
A + B + C = 180°
++++

== Convert Degree to Radiant

[stem]
++++
360° = 2 pi " rads"
++++

To convert stem:[x] degrees to radians stem:[y]:

[stem]
++++
x * pi/180 = y
++++

For example, stem:[255°]:

[stem]
++++
225 * pi/180 ~~ 3.93 " rads"
++++

== Trigonometrical Ratios

_Sinus_, _cosinus_ and _tangens_ are trigonometric functions that can be applied
to *right-angled triangles* to determine the degree of an angle. The degree of
an angle is independent from the length of each side.

[stem]
++++
sin theta = ("side opposite to " theta)/"hypothenuse" = "BC"/"AC"\
cos theta = ("side adjacent to " theta)/"hypothenuse" = "AB"/"AC"\
tan theta = ("side opposite to " theta)/("side adjacent to " theta) = "BC"/"AB"
++++

_Sinus_ and _cosinus_ are always less than one.

[stem]
++++
sin x <= 1\
cos x <= 1
++++

The ratio of an angle can be reversed.

[stem]
++++
sin 45° = 0.70710678\
sin^(-1) 0.70710678 = 45°
++++

== Sinus and Cosinus Rule

In case of non right-angled triangles, where _sinus_, _cosinus_ and _tangens_
cannot be applied, the sinus and cosinus rules can be used instead:

[stem]
++++
a/(sin A) = b/(sin B) = c/(sin C)
++++

and:

[stem]
++++
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos A\
b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac cos B\
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos C
++++
