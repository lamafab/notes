== Exponential Expressions

An expression of the form stem:[a^x] is called an **exponential expression**,
where _a_ is the **base** and _x_ is the **exponent**,**power** or **index**.

NOTE: The most common exponential expression is stem:[e^x], where _e_ is the
constant _2.71828..._. Also known as "Euler's number". This number is found in
many natural phenomena.

== Exponential Functions

An exponential function has the form of stem:[y = e^x]. This function has important properties:

* _y_ is never negative.
* When stem:[x=0], then stem:[y = 1]
* As _x_ increases, then _y_ increases (**exponential growth**).

== Logarithms

The logarithm is the inverse function to the exponentiation.

[stem]
++++
y = a^x " is equivalant to " log_a y = x
++++

For example:

[stem]
++++
5^3 = 125\
log_5 125 = 3
++++

Also, conventially we define **natural logarithms** as:

[stem]
++++
log = log_10\
ln = log_e
++++

=== Some Properties

[stem]
++++
log_a X = (log_10 X)/(log_10 a)\
log_a X = (ln X)/(ln_a)
++++

and:

[stem]
++++
log_a a = 1
++++

and:

[stem]
++++
log 1 = 0
++++

=== Laws

**First Law**:

[stem]
++++
log A + log B = log AB
++++

**Second Law**:

[stem]
++++
log A - log B = log (A/B)
++++

**Third Law**

[stem]
++++
n log A = log A^n
++++

such as stem:[3 log 2 = log 2^3 = log 8]. This applies for all stem:[n in RR].
