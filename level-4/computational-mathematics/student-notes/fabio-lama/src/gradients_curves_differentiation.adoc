== Gradient Function

The **gradient** (or "slope") of a graph tells us something about the rate of
change and "steepness" of a function. Given a function stem:[y = f(x)] we denote
its gradient function by stem:[(dy)/(dx)] or simply by stem:[y'].

TODO: What is _d_?

The gradient function is also called **(first) derivative**. The process of
obtaining this is also known as **differentiation**. Saying to differentiate
stem:[y = x^5] means to find its gradient function stem:[y]. _Differential
calculus_ studies this more in depth.

=== Gradient function of stem:[y = x^n]

For any function of the form stem:[y = x^n] the gradient function is found from
the following formula:

[stem]
++++
y = x^n " then " y' = nx^(n-1)
++++

When we substitute _x_ and the result is negative, the curve is falling. If the
result is positive, the curve is rising. We write stem:[y'(x = 2)] or simply
stem:[y'(2)] to denote the value of the gradient function when stem:[x = 2].

TODO: Add some examples.

== Rules for Finding Gradient Functions

**Rule 1**: To find the gradient function of a sum of two functions we can simply find the two gradient functions separately and those together.

[stem]
++++
y = f(x) + g(x) " then " y' = f'(x) + g'(x)
++++

**Rule 2**: Extension of the first rule.

[stem]
++++
y = f(x) - g(x) " then " y' = f'(x) - g'(x)
++++

**Rule 3**: 

[stem]
++++
y = kf(x) " then " y' = kf'(x)
++++

where _k_ is a number.

== Higher Derivatives

To find the derivative of the derivative itself, known as the **second
deriviative** and denoted as stem:[y''], we define:

[stem]
++++
y'' = (d^2y)/(dx^2)
++++

stem:[y''] is found by differentiating stem:[y'].
