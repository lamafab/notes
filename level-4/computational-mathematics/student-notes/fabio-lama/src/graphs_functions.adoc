== Intro

We introduce horizontal and vertical axes. These axes intersect at a point
stem:[O] called the origin. The horizontal axis is used to represent the
*independent* variable, commonly stem:[x], and the vertical axis is used to
represent the *dependent* variable, commonly stem:[y]. The region shown is then
referred to as the stem:[x â€“ y] plane.

== Inequalities

Adding and subtracting the same quantity from both sides of an inequality leaves
the inequality unchanged. Hence, for any quantity stem:[k] if:

[stem]
++++
x > y
++++

then:

[stem]
++++
x + k > y + k " and " x -k > y -k
++++

Multiplying and dividing *positive* quantity then the inequality remains
*unchanged*. If stem:[x > y] and stem:[k] is positive, then:

[stem]
++++
kx > ky " and " x/k > y/k
++++

Multiplying and dividing *negative* quantity then the inequality is *reversed*. 
If stem:[x > y] and stem:[k] is negative, then:

[stem]
++++
kx < ky " and " x/k < y/k
++++

== Intervals

We only need part of the stem:[x]/stem:[y] axis when plottin graphs. Each
coordinate on the axis is called an *interval*. There are three types of
intervals:

* _Closed interval_: includes its end-points, e.g. stem:[{x:x in bbb R, 1 <= x <= 3}], denoted as stem:[[1,3\]] (square brackets).
* _Open interval_: does not include its end-points, e.g. stem:[{x:x in bbb R, 1 < x < 3}], denoted as stem:[(1,3)] (round brackets).
* _Semi-open and semi-closed interval_: may be open at one end and closed at the other, e.g. stem:[{x:x in bbb R, 1 < x <= 3}], denoted as stem:[(1,3\]] (round and square bracket).

Closed intervals use the filled marking, stem:[[-3,4\]]:

Open intervals used the hollow marking, stem:[(1,4)]:

== Plotting Graphs of a Function

Plotting a graph of stem:[y = 2x - 1] for stem:[-3 <= x <= 3]:

|===
|stem:[x]|stem:[-3]|stem:[-2]|stem:[-1]|stem:[0]|stem:[1]|stem:[2]|stem:[3]
|stem:[y]|stem:[-7]|stem:[-5]|stem:[-3]|stem:[-1]|stem:[1]|stem:[3]|stem:[5]
|===

== Domain and Range of Function

The set of values that we allow the independent variable to take is called the
*domain* of the function. If the domain is not specified, we take the largest
set possible. The set of values taken by the output is called the *range* of
function. The domain and range can extend indefinitely (infinite) in one or both
directions.

For example, the function stem:[f] is given by stem:[y = f(x) = 2x], for stem:[1 <= x <= 3].
