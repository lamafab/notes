== Intro

Some events are impossible, while others are quite certain to happen. When
something is impossible, we say that the probability is **0**. If something is
very likely going to happen, we say the probability is **1**. We use the letter
**P** to indicate a probability of something occuring.

P("a human will live for 1'000 years") = 0
P("all of us will die someday") = 1

No probabilities are outside the range of 0 to 1.
