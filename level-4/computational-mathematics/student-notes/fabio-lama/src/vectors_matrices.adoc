== Intro

Quantities that can be described as single numbers (**magnitudes**) are known as
**scalars**. Vectors are quantities that have a magnitude but also a
**direction** and are represented as arrows, where the length represents the
magnitude and the direction is given as points on a Euclidean plane:

Here, the vector _A_ to _B_ is written as stem:[vec "AB"] (sometimes stem:[ul a]
or stem:[bb a]), where _A_ is the _tail_ and _B_ is the _head_. The
**magnitude** of stem:[vec "AB"] is written as stem:[vec abs(AB)] or stem:[bb
ul a].

Two vectors are **equal** if they have the same magnitude **and** the same
direction.

A **unit vector** has magnitude of 1, written as stem:[bb hat a]

== Multiplying Vector by Scalar

[stem]
++++
bb a = 4\
3 bb a = 12\
1/2 bb a = 2
++++

Multiplying by a negative number **reverses** the direction, but the magnitude
stays **positive**. 

[stem]
++++
bb a = 4\
-3 bb a = 12
++++

The unit vector of stem:[bb a] is given by:

[stem]
++++
bb hat a = (1)/(bb abs(a)) bba
++++

For example:

[stem]
++++
bb a = 4\
bb hat a = 1/4 bb a\
bb b = 1/2\
bb hat b = 1/(1/2) bb b = 2 bb b
++++
