== Intro

Formal definition: given a set stem:[X] a sequence is a function stem:[a: N -> X].

"Series": A sequence derived from another sequence.

{a_n} " with " n = {0, 1, 2, ...}\
= {a_0, a_0+a_1,a_0+a_1+a_2,a_0+a_1+a_2+a_3, ...}
++++

* stem:[{s_n}] is called a series, it is a type of sequence that is obtained as
sum of the elements of another sequence.

* A series is also indicated with stem:[sum -> s_n = sum_(i=0)^n a_i]

*(intermezzo) Mathematical induction principle*: if a property is valid for
stem:[n=0], and if, _assuming it is valid for stem:[n], it remains valid also
for stem:[n+1]_, then the property is valid for any stem:[n].

s_n = sum_(k=0)^n (a_0+k xx q) = (n+1)(2 a_0 + n xx q) div 2 (x)

prove stem:[x] is true for stem:[n=0], then prove that stem:[s_(n+1) =
s_n+a_(n+1) = (x) + a_0 xx q^(n+1)]
