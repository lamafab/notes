== Predicates

**Predicates** describe properties of objects.

For example:

[stem]
++++
"odd"(3)
++++

stem:["odd"(3)] means stem:[3] is an odd number. stem:["odd"] is a predicate,
stem:[3] is an object. Predicates take arguments and become **propositions**.

Connectives can be applied:

[stem]
++++
"odd"(3) ^^ "prime"(3)
++++

This means that stem:[3] is odd but also prime.

== Quantifiers

We use the symbol stem:[EE] to indicate the existence of something
(**existential quantifier**).

[stem]
++++
EE x " odd"(x)
++++

This means that there exists some stem:[x] that is odd.

We denote the **univeral quantifier** as stem:[AA].

[stem]
++++
AA x  ("odd"(x) vv "even"(x))
++++

This meant that **for all** stem:[x] the number is either even or odd.

Other examples, "All Ps are Qs":

[stem]
++++
AA x (P(x) -> Q(x))
++++

And "No Ps are Qs":

[stem]
++++
AA x (P(x) -> not Q(x))
++++
