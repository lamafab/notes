== Intro

A proposition is a statement that can be either _true_ or _false_. It must be
one or the other, and it cannot be both.

== Syntax

Propositions are denoted by capital letters, such as stem:[P, Q, ...]. General
statements are denoted by lowercase letters, such as stem:[p, q, ...]

== Connectives

**Logical NOT**: stem:[not p] is true if and only if stem:[p] is false (also
called _negation_).

**Logical OR**: stem:[p vv q] is true if and only if at least one of stem:[p] or
stem:[q] is true or if both stem:[p] and stem:[q] are true (also called
_disjunction_).

**Logical AND**: stem:[p ^^ q] is true if and only if both stem:[p] and stem:[q]
are true (also called _conjunction_).

**Logical IF...THEN**: stem:[p -> q] is true if and only if either stem:[p] is
false or stem:[q] is true (also called _conditional_ or _implication_). stem:[p]
is the premise, stem:[q] is the conclusion.

**Logical IF and only IF**: stem:[p harr q] is true if and only if both stem:[p]
and stem:[q] are true (also called _bi-conditional_).

**Exclusive OR: XOR**: stem:[p o+ q] is true if stem:[p] or stem:[q] is true but
not both.

=== Translation to Connectives

As an example, lets consider the propositions:

* stem:[P = "I study 20 hours a week"]
* stem:[R = "I will pass the exam"]
* stem:[S = "I will be happy"]
* stem:[Q = "I attend all the lectures"]

And the following connectives:

[stem]
++++
(P vv Q) -> (R ^^ S)
++++

which is a translation of:  "**If** I study 20 hours a week **or** attend all
the lectures, **then** I will pass the exam **and** I will be happy."

== Truth Tables

=== Negation: stem:[not]

[stem]
++++
true = not false\
false = not true
++++

=== Conjunction: stem:[^^]

[stem]
++++
true ^^ true = true\
true ^^ false = false\
false ^^ true = false\
false ^^ false = false
++++

=== Disjunction: stem:[vv]

[stem]
++++
true vv true = true\
true vv false = true\
false vv true = true\
false vv false = false
++++

=== Implication: stem:[->]

[stem]
++++
true -> true = true\
true -> false = false\
false -> true = true \
false -> false = true 
++++

====
NOTE: This can seem weird at first, this answer helps: https://math.stackexchange.com/a/100288

> If you start out with a false premise, then, as far as implication is
concerned, you are free to conclude anything. (This corresponds to the fact
that, when stem:[p] is false, the implication stem:[p -> q] is true no matter
what stem:[q] is.)

> If you start out with a true premise, then the implication should be true only
when the conclusion is also true. (This corresponds to the fact that, when
stem:[p] is true, the truth of the implication is the same as the truth of
stem:[q].)

=== Bi-conditional: stem:[harr]

[stem]
++++
1 harr 1 = 1\
1 harr 0 = 0\
0 harr 1 = 0\
0 harr 0 = 1
++++

=== Exclusive or: XOR, stem:[o+]

[stem]
++++
1 o+ 1 = 0\
1 o+ 0 = 1\
0 o+ 1 = 1\
0 o+ 0 = 0
++++

== Operator Precedence

Operators are applied in the following order (ascending):

. stem:[not]
. stem:[^^]
. stem:[vv]
. stem:[->]
. stem:[harr]

For example:

[stem]
++++
p -> p ^^ not q vv s -= (p -> ((p ^^ (not q)) vv s))
++++

== Descriptors

A formula that's always true is called a **tautology**. A formula that is true
for at least one scenario is **consistent**. A formula that's never true is
**inconsistent**. A formula can also result in a **contradiction**.

== Equivalances

Formulas are equivalanent if they result in the same logical outcomes.

For example (_De Morgan's Laws_):

[stem]
++++
not (p ^^ q) -= not p vv not q\
not (p vv q) -= not p ^^ not q
++++

By using the first formula, we can see:

[stem]
++++
not (true ^^ true) = not true = false\
not true vv not true = false vv false = false
++++
