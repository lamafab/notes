== Intro

(NOTE: Reading the _Postulates of Boolean Algebra_ cheatsheet is recommended here)

Logic gates are basic elements of circuits implementing Boolean operations. The
most basic circuits are **OR** gates, **AND** gates and invertors (**NOT**
gates). All boolean functions can be written in terms of these three logic
operations.

* **AND** operation is represented as stem:[f = x . y] or stem:[f = xy].
* **OR** operation is represented as stem:[f = x + y].
* **NOT** operation is represented as stem:[f = bar x].

Other gates:

* **XOR** operation is _true_ only when the value of the inputs differ.
* **NAND** operations is equivalent to "not AND".
* **NOR** operation is equivalent to "not OR".
* **XNOR** operation is equivalent to a "not XOR".

AND, OR, XOR and XNOR are **commutative** (e.g. stem:[a + b = b + a]) and
**associative** (e.g. stem:[a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c]). NAND and NOR are
commutative but not associative.
