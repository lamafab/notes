== Intro

A universal set is a set that contains everything. We note the universal set
with the letter stem:[U].

[stem]
++++
A sube U
++++

== Complement of a Set

The complement of set stem:[A] contains all elements of stem:[U] but not
stem:[A].

[stem]
++++
bar A = U-A
++++

and therefore:

[stem]
++++
bar A uu A = U
++++

For example:

[stem]
++++
U = {1, 2, 3, 4}\
A = {1, 2}\
bar A = {3, 4}\
A uu bar A = {1, 2, 3, 4} = U
++++

== De Morgan's Law

The complement of the **union** of two sets stem:[A] and stem:[B] is equal to the
**intersection** of their complements.

[stem]
++++
bar (A uu B) = bar A nn bar B
++++

The complement of the **intersection** of two sets stem:[A] and stem:[B] is equal to
the **union** of their complements.

[stem]
++++
bar (A nn B) = bar A uu bar B
++++

For example:

[stem]
++++
U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\
A = {1, 2, 3, 4} " and " B = {4, 5, 6}\
A uu B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} " and " A nn B = {4}\
bar (A uu B) = {7, 8} " and " bar (A nn B) = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}\
bar A = {5, 6, 7, 8} " and " bar B = {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}
++++

We conclude:

[stem]
++++
bar (A uu B) = {7, 8} = bar A nn bar B\
bar (A nn B) = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8} = bar A uu bar B
++++

== Laws of Sets

=== Commutativity

Unions, intersections and symmetric differences are commutative.

[stem]
++++
A uu B = B uu A\
A nn B = B nn A\
A o+ B = B o+ A
++++

Set difference is **not** commutative.

[stem]
++++
A - B != B -A
++++

For example:

[stem]
++++
A = {1, 2, 3}\
B = {3, 4, 5}\
A - B = {1, 2}\
B -A = {4 , 5}
++++

=== Associativity

Unions, intersections and symmetric differences are associative.

[stem]
++++
A uu (B uu C) = (A uu B) uu C\
A nn (B nn C) = (A nn B) nn C\
A o+ (B o+ C) = (A o+ B) o+ C
++++

Set difference is **not** associative:

[stem]
++++
A - (B - C) != (A - B - C)
++++

For example:

[stem]
++++
A = {1, 2, 3}\
B = {3, 4, 5}\
C = {3}\
A - (B - C) = {1, 2, 3}\
(A - B) - C = {1, 2}
++++

=== Distributive

Unions and  intersections are distributive.

[stem]
++++
A uu (B nn C) = (A uu B) nn (A uu C)\
A nn (B uu C) = (A nn B) uu (A nn C)\
++++

== Set Identities

=== Unions

[stem]
++++
A uu B = B uu A\
(A uu B) uu C = A uu (B uu C)\
A uu (B nn C) = (A uu B) nn (A uu C)\
bar (A uu B) = bar A nn bar B\
A uu phi = A\
A uu U = U\
A uu bar A = U\
bar U = phi\
bar bar A = A\
A uu (A nn B) = A\
A - B = A nn bar B
++++

=== Intersections

[stem]
++++
A nn B = B nn A\
(A nn B) nn C = A nn (B nn C)\
A nn (B uu C) = (A nn B) uu (A nn C)\
bar (A nn B) = bar A uu bar B\
A nn phi = phi\
A nn U = A\
A nn bar A = phi\
bar phi = U\
A nn (A uu B) = A
++++
