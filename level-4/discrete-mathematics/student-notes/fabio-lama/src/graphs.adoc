== Intro

Graphs are **discrete** structures consisting of **vertices (nodes)** and
**edges** connecting them. Graph theory is an area of discrete mathematics which
studies these types of discrete structures.

The **graph** stem:[G] can be represented as an ordered pair stem:[G = (V, E)],
where stem:[V] is a set of nodes/vertices and stem:[E] is a set of edges, lines
or connections. A **vertex** (singular of "vertices") is a basic element of a graph,
usually drawn as a node or a dot. The set of vertices of stem:[G] is usually
denoted by stem:[V(G)] or stem:[V].

An **edge** is a link between 2 vertices, usually drawn as a line connecting two
vertices. The set of edges in a graph stem:[G] is usually denoted by stem:[E(G)]
or stem:[E].

Two vertices are said to be **adjacent** if they are endpoints of the same edge.
Two edges are said to be **adjacent** if they share the same vertex. If a vertex
stem:[v] is an endpoint of an edge stem:[e], then we say that stem:[e] and
stem:[v] are **incident**.

A **directed graph**, also called a **digraph**, is a graph in which the edges
have a direction. This is usually indicated with an arrow on the edge.

== Concepts

=== Walk

A **walk** is a sequence of vertices and edges of a graph were vertices and
edges can be repeated. A **walk of length k** in a graph is a succession of
stem:[k] (not necessarily different) edges of the form stem:[uv, vw, wx, ...,
yz].

image::./assets/graphs/graph_walk.png[align=center, width=600]

=== Trail

A **trail** is a walk in which no edge is repeated. In a trail, vertices can be
repeated but no edge is ever repeated. For example, stem:[e1, e2, e3, e5, e6]
is a trail:

image::./assets/graphs/graph_trail.png[align=center, width=350]

=== Circuit

A **circuit** is a closed trail. Circuits can have repeated vertices only. For
example, stem:[e7,e6, e8, e3, e2, e1] is a circuit:

image::./assets/graphs/graph_circuit.png[align=center, width=350]

=== Path

A **path** is a trail in which neither vertices nor edges are repeated.

=== Cycle

A **cycle** is a closed path, consisting of edges and vertices where a vertex is
reachable from itself.

image::./assets/graphs/graph_cycle.png[align=center, width=500]

=== Eulerian Path

A **Eulerian path** in a graph is a path that uses each edge precisely once. If
such a path exists, the graph is called **traversable**.

image::./assets/graphs/graph_euler_path.png[align=center, width=550]

=== Hamiltonian Path, Cycle & Graph

A **Hamiltonian path** (also called a _traceable path_) is a path that visits
each vertex exactly once. A **Hamiltonian cycle** is a cycle that visits each
vertex exactly once (except for the starting vertex, which is visited once at
the start and once again at the end).

image::./assets/graphs/graph_hamiltonian_cycle.png[align=center, width=450]

A graph that contains a Hamiltonian cycle is called a **Hamiltonian graph**. Any
Hamiltonian cycle can be converted to a Hamiltonian path by removing one of its
edges.

=== Connectivity

An **undirected** graph is **connected** if you can get from **any node to any other**
by following a **sequence of edges**. Or, **any two nodes** are **connected** by a path.

image::./assets/graphs/graph_connectivity.png[align=center, width=350]

A directed graph is **strongly connected** if there is a **directed path** from
any node to any other node.

=== Transitive Close

Given a digraph stem:[G], the transitive closure of stem:[G] is the digraph
stem:[G^**] such that stem:[G^**] has the same vertices as stem:[G]. If
stem:[G] has a directed path from stem:[u] to stem:[v] (stem:[u != v]),
stem:[G^**] has a directed edge from stem:[u] to stem:[v].

== Degree of a Vertex

The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident on stem:[v]. A loop
contributes **twice** to the degree. An **isolated vertex** has a degree of
stem:[0].

image::./assets/graphs/degree_vertex.png[align=center, width=400]

In the case of directed graphs, stem:["In-deg"(v)] is the number of edges for
which stem:[v] is the terminal vertex. stem:["Out-deg"(v)] is the number of
edges for which stem:[v] is the initial vertex.

And the degree stem:["deg"(v)] is:

[stem]
++++
"deg"(v) = "Out-deg"(v) + "In-deg"(v)
++++

A loop contributes **twice** to the degree as it contributes stem:[1] to both
in-degree and out-degree.

image::./assets/graphs/degree_in_out_vertex.png[align=center, width=400]

=== Degree Sequence

Given an undirected graph stem:[G], a **degree sequence** is a **monotonic
non-increasing** sequence of the vertex degrees of all the vertices of stem:[G].
The **sum of the degree sequence** of a graph is always **even**.

image::./assets/graphs/degree_sequence.png[align=center, width=450]

Given a graph stem:[G], the sum of the degree sequence of stem:[G] is twice the
number of edges in stem:[G].

[stem]
++++
"Number of edges of "G = ("sum of degree sequences of " G)/2
++++

== Special Graphs

=== Simple Graphs

A **simple graph** is a graph without **loops** and **parallel** edges.

image::./assets/graphs/simple_graphs.png[align=center, width=500]

Given a **simple** graph stem:[G] with stem:[n] vertices, then the degree of
each vertex of stem:[G] is at most equal to stem:[n-1].

=== Regular Graphs

A graph is said to be **regular** of degree if all local degrees are the same
number. A graph stem:[G] where all the vertices are of the same degree,
stem:[r], is called an **r-regular** graph.

image::./assets/graphs/regular_graphs.png[align=center, width=550]

Given a **r-regular** graph stem:[G] with stem:[n] vertices, then the following
is true:

[stem]
++++
"Degree sequence of " G = r, r, r, ..., r " " (n " times")\
"Sum of degree sequence of " G = r xx n\
"Number of edges in " G = r xx n/2
++++

image::./assets/graphs/regular_graphs_example.png[align=center, width=350]

=== Special Regular Graphs: Cycles

image::./assets/graphs/graph_regular_cycles.png[align=center, width=350]

=== Complete Graphs

A **complete graph** is a **simple** graph where **every pair of vertices** are
**adjacent** (linked with an edge). We represent a complete graph with stem:[n]
vertices using the symbol stem:[K_n].

image::./assets/graphs/graph_complete.png[align=center, width=450]

A complete graph with stem:[n] vertices, stem:[k_n], has the following
properties:

[stem]
++++
"Every vertex has a degree " (n-1)\
"Sum of degree sequence" = n(n-1)\
"Number of edges" = (n(n-1))/n
++++
