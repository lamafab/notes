== Intro

Graphs are **discrete** structures consisting of **vertices (nodes)** and
**edges** connecting them. Graph theory is an area of discrete mathematics which
studies these types of discrete structures.

The **graph** stem:[G] can be represented as an ordered pair stem:[G = (V, E)],
where stem:[V] is a set of nodes/vertices and stem:[E] is a set of edges, lines
or connections. A **vertex** (singular of "vertices") is a basic element of a graph,
usually drawn as a node or a dot. The set of vertices of stem:[G] is usually
denoted by stem:[V(G)] or stem:[V].

An **edge** is a link between 2 vertices, usually drawn as a line connecting two
vertices. The set of edges in a graph stem:[G] is usually denoted by stem:[E(G)]
or stem:[E].

Two vertices are said to be **adjacent** if they are endpoints of the same edge.
Two edges are said to be **adjacent** if they share the same vertex. If a vertex
stem:[v] is an endpoint of an edge stem:[e], then we say that stem:[e] and
stem:[v] are **incident**.

A **directed graph**, also called a **digraph**, is a graph in which the edges have a direction. This is usually indicated with an arrow on the edge.
