== Intro

A function maps one element from a set to **exactly one** element of another (or
the same) set.

For example, we have sets:

[stem]
++++
A = {1, 2, 3}\
B = {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
++++

and the function:

[stem]
++++
f: A -> B
++++

defined as:

[stem]
++++
f(x) = 2x
++++

Now lets apply each element from stem:[A] to stem:[f]:

[stem]
++++
f(1) = 2\
f(2) = 4\
f(3) = 6
++++

We call set stem:[A] the **domain** and set stem:[B] the **co-domain**. The set
of all possible values when mapping elements from set stem:[A] to set stem:[B],
respectively set stem:[R = {2, 4, 6}], is called the **range**. Hence stem:[R
sube B].

Additionally, we say that stem:[1] is the **pre-image** of stem:[2], which in
return is the **image** of stem:[1]. The element stem:[2] is the pre-image of
stem:[4], which in return is the image of stem:[2]. And so on.

* **General function**: stem:[A] has at most one stem:[B] (not injective, not surjective).
* **Injective**: stem:[A] has exactly one stem:[B] (not surjective).
* **Surjective**: _Each and every_ stem:[B] has one or many stem:[A] (not
injective).
* **Bijective**: _Each and every_ stem:[B] has exactly one stem:[A] (injective
and surjective).
* **NOT a function**: stem:[A] has many stem:[B].

=== Proofs

We can prove whether a function is injective, surjective or bijective by solving
an equation. Lets use the following function as an example:

[stem]
++++
f(x) = 2x + 3
++++

Injective Proof::

Let stem:[a, b in R], show that if stem:[a != b] then stem:[f(a) != f(b)]:

[stem]
++++
a != b " " xx 2\
2a != 2b " " + 3\
2a + 3 != 2b + 3\
=> f(a) != f(b)
++++

**Or:** Let stem:[a, b in R], show that if stem:[f(a) = f(b)] then stem:[a = b]:

[stem]
++++
f(a) = f(b) =>\
2a + 3 = 2b + 3 " " -3\
2a = 2b " " -: 2\
a = b
++++

Hence, function stem:[f] is injective.

Surjective Proof::

Let stem:[y in R], show that there exists stem:[x in R] such that stem:[f(x) = y]:

[stem]
++++
f(x) = y =>\
2x + 3 = y " " -3\
2x = y -3 " " -: 2\
x = (y -3)/2
++++

Hence, function stem:[f] is surjective.

== Composition

Function composition means we apply one function to the result of another.

For example:

[stem]
++++
(f @ g)(x) = f(g(x))
++++

which means that the result of stem:[g()] is passed on to stem:[f()]. If we
define stem:[f(x) = 2x] and stem:[g(x) = x^2], then:

[stem]
++++
(f @ g)(5) = f(g(x)) = 2xx(5^2) = 50
++++

Do note that function composition is not commutative, meaning stem:[f @ g != g
@ f]:

[stem]
++++
(f @ g)(5) = f(g(x)) = 2xx(5^2) = 50\
(g @ f)(5) = g(f(x)) = (5xx2)^2 = 100
++++

== Inverse Function

If function stem:[f] is bijective, then there exists an inverse function
stem:[f^(-1)].

[stem]
++++
f: A -> B\
f^(-1): B -> A
++++

For example, given stem:[f(x) = 2x], then stem:[f^(-1)(x) = x/2].

[stem]
++++
f(2) = 4\
f^(-1)(4) = 2
++++

Additionally:

[stem]
++++
(f @ f^(-1))(x) = (f^(-1) @ f)(x) = x
++++
