== Intro

Boolean algebra describes the field of study where the values of variables are
_true_ or _false_. The following operators are used:

* **AND**: represented as stem:[x.y, x nn y] or stem:[x ^^ y]
* **OR**: represented as stem:[x + y, x uu y] or stem:[x vv y]
* **NOT**: represented as stem:[x', bar x] or stem:[not x]

Order of precedence: stem:["NOT" > "AND" > "OR"]

=== Axioms

The following axioms must be satisfied by any boolean algebra:

* **closure**: any result of logical operations belongs to the set stem:[{0, 1}]
(_true_ or _false_).
* **identity**: elements have an identity for the applied operator:
	* stem:[x + 0 = x]
	* stem:[x . 1 = x]
* **commutativity**: the order of the applied operators does not matter.
	* stem:[x + y = y + x]
	* stem:[x . y = y . x]
* **distributivity**:
	* stem:[x(y + z) = (x . y) + (x . z)]
	* stem:[x + (y . z) = (x + y) . (x + z)]
* **complements**: exist for all the elements
	* stem:[x + x' = 1]
	* stem:[x. x' = 0]
* **distinct elements**:
	* stem:[0 != 1]
