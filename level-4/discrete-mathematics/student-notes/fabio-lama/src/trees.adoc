== Definition

In computer science, **trees** are used in a wide range of algorithms, such as
data structures for efficient lookups or making decisions. A tree is a
**connected acyclic undirected graph**.

=== Acyclic Graphs

A graph stem:[G] is called an **acyclic** graph if and only if stem:[G] has **no
cycles**.

.stem:[G_1] is NOT an acyclic graph, while stem:[G_2] is.

Not all acyclic graphs are trees.

=== Forest

A **forest** is a **disconnected graph** containing no cycles.

Theorem 1::

An undirected graph is a **tree** if and only if there is a **unique simple
path** between **any two** of its vertices.

Theorem 2::
A tree with **stem:[n] vertices** has **stem:[n-1] edges**.

=== Rooted Tree

A **rooted tree** is when one vertex has been **designated as the root** and
every edge is **directed away from the root**.

== Spanning Tree

A **spanning tree** of a graph stem:[G] is a **connected** sub graph of stem:[G]
which **contains all vertices of stem:[G]**, but with **no cycles**.

.All stem:[T_n] are spanning sub graphs of graph stem:[G].

=== Constructing a Spanning Tree

To get a spanning tree of a graph stem:[G]:

. Keep all vertices of stem:[G]
. Break all the cycles but keep the tree connected.

Two spanning trees are said **isomorphic** if there is a **bijection preserving
adjacency** between the two trees.

.stem:[T_1], stem:[T_3] and stem:[T_4] are all **isomorphic** to each others. stem:[T_1], stem:[T_3] and stem:[T_4] are all **non-isomorphic** to stem:[T_2].
