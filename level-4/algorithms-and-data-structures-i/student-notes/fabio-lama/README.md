# About

Listed here is a collection of cheatsheet by topic. Those cheatsheets do not
explain the topics in depth, but rather serve as quick lookup documents.
Therefore, the course material provided by the lecturer should still be studied
and understood. Not everything that is tested at the mid-terms or final exams is
covered and the Author does not guarantee that the cheatsheets are free of
errors.

# Building

_NOTE_: This step is only necessary if you chose to modify the base documents.

The base documents are written in [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/) and can be
found in the `src/` directory.

The following dependencies must be installed (Ubuntu):

```console
$ apt install -y ruby-dev wkhtmltopdf
$ gem install asciidoctor
$ chmod +x build.sh
```

To build the documents (PDF version):

```console
$ ./build.sh pdf
```

Optionally, for the HTML version:

```console
$ ./build.sh html
```

and for the PNG version:

```console
$ ./build.sh png
```

The generated output can be deleted with `./build.sh clean`.
